# Booking.Me
Booking.Me is gonna be one of the most popular and useful app in Cambodia's Market.

I believe that this app is going to change the whole point of view of techology and I believe this app is going to solve the problem that we are all face nowaday without noticing.

This app is going to serve as a assistance of reservation, and make sure that you go out for a day without any interruption or delay your work. Booking.Me will expand its influence all around Cambodia and also will compete with international app just like, Booking.com, Trip.com, etc. This app is out because I saw the lack of user experience out of the bunch of apps out there.

Big app only focus on the most important need, but Booking.Me is different, we focus more on the little thing on life that you would not think about, but I garentee you that you can not live without it after using it, I mean if you wait 2 hours just because you want to eat at a place you want to eat, your day is ruined. So that's why this app is exist. 

The scope of this app is to make sure that everything that you need gather in this app such as, book a study room, make a reservation for table, hotel, service reservation, foods & drinks (espcailly for pick up service), interview schedule, even booking your friend. YES!! i mean that literally if you want to hang out with your friend use this app to arrange teh date and time, so whether he/she available during that time or not, you will know.

This app is exist out of my own struggle, there is one time, it is a busy day, and I want to eat at a place that so popular in Cambodia, but fate would not let my life goes so easy, I have to wait and there are 10 people above me on the list, and it's f#cked me up. I hate when that's happening, so I decide to go to another place to eat just to make sure I can eat the fimilar dish. Turn out it's a waste of money that I've been saving so far, the food is so unacceptable. 
There is another story that can help us about this app, as we want our parent to eat something that's also a popular place but suddenly we have to wait 30 minutes for that one table, isn't that suck? I mean the adult like us can wait but they can't. What if you goes on your phone and click to make a reservation about the place and when you arrived to the place, you can eat. isn't that great?



##IMPORTANT: how do I make money out of this app?? I mean I can't do it for free, I got myself, my family, my future wife, future kids. can someone help me with that.
